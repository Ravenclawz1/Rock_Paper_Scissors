# ✊✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 📅 Built In

**December 2024**

## 📖 Background

I built this project back in **December 2024**, when I was just starting out with web development. At that time, I didn’t really know much about tech, self-learning, or how developers shared their work. I just knew I wanted to make something fun and learn while doing it.

Only **recently**, I understood the real importance of **GitHub** — not just as a place to upload code, but as a platform to communicate, showcase, and track your projects. That’s why I’m uploading this now. It might be simple, but it represents where I started.

## ✨ Features

- User vs Computer gameplay
- Random computer move generation
- Displays result (Win / Lose / Draw)

- **Recently**: Why GitHub is important for communication, collaboration, and growth

## 🔁 Future Improvements

- Add single-player vs AI difficulty levels

## 🧠 Reflection

This project marks one of my first steps into coding. At the time, I didn’t know how to use GitHub or the value it holds. Now that I understand it, I’m uploading this to document my journey and share what I’ve built — however small it may be. Every project counts, and this one was where it all started.
